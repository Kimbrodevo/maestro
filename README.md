Maestro
============

A command line tool for Container orchestration and management in multi-container docker environments. Container sets are defined in a simple YAML format that mirrors the options available in the Docker API. The intention is to be able to easily launch, orchestrate and destroy complex multi-node envionments for testing and development.

This is what it currently looks like to use maestro and deploy a multi-tier node.js/mongodb application. All that's required is a maestro.yml in the root of the repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kstaken/express-todo-example.git
$ cd express-todo-example && maestro build
Building template mongodb
Launching instance of template mongodb named mongodb
Starting container mongodb - 8e766a36e5be
Starting nodejs: waiting for service mongodb on ip 172.16.1.83 and port 27017
Found service mongodb on ip 172.16.1.83 and port 27017
Building template nodejs
Launching instance of template nodejs named nodejs
Starting container nodejs - 40053c060f27
Launched.

$ maestro ps
ID            NODE               COMMAND                                     STATUS     PORTS
8e766a36e5be  mongodb            /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf  Running
40053c060f27  nodejs             /usr/bin/node /var/www/app.js               Running    49289->80
```

And the app would be accessible on http://localhost:49289/.

Status
======

Early development. It can be useful for testing and development but the feature set and configuration format are changing rapidly.

Note: this project used to be called DockerMix.

Features
========

- Build/start/stop/destroy multi-container docker environments via simple commands
- Declarative YAML format to specify container configurations for the environment
- Easily launch multiple instances of the same container for testing cluster operations
- Specify dependencies between containers so they start in order and wait for services to become available
- Automatically configure dependent containers to know where to locate services from other containers in the same environment
- ... Much more to come

Dependencies
=============

- Docker: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker
- docker-py: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-py
- Python pip package manager

Installation
============

Install Docker as described here: http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/

Then:
```
    sudo apt-get install -y python-pip
    git clone https://github.com/toscanini/maestro.git
    cd maestro
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt 
    sudo python setup.py install
    docker pull ubuntu
```

Configuration File Format
=========================

**Note:** This format is changing heavily.

The configuration file defines an environment that is made up of multiple templates that can be used to generate containers. The templates can have relationships defined between them to specify start order and Maestro will handle starting instances of the templates in containers in the correct order and then providing environment configuration to the containers.

This example will setup two templates, one for nodejs and one for mongodb. The nodejs template depends on mongodb so that when you start the environment no nodejs containers will be started until a mongdb container is fully up and running.

In this instance the templates are built from repositories stored on Github but there are various ways to set these up.

```
templates:
  nodejs: 
    config:
      command: /usr/bin/node /var/www/app.js
      ports: 
        - '80'  
      environment:
        - PORT=80
    buildspec:
      url: github.com/toscanini/docker-nodejs
    require:
      mongodb: 
        port: '27017'
  mongodb:     
    config:
      command: /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf
    buildspec:
      url: github.com/toscanini/docker-mongodb
```

To build and launch an environment you just place this config in a file named `maestro.yml` then run `maestro build`. It will take a few seconds to start as it waits for MongoDB to initialize. Currently the environment state lives in the current directory but that will have more flexibility in the future.

Templates also define a basic docker configuration so that you can pre-define the parameters used on docker run.

`base_image` is the Docker container to use to run the command. It must already exist on the system and won't be pulled automatically.

`base_image` and `command` are the only required options if no `buildspec` is provided. If `buildspec` is provided `base_image` can be omitted

You can use `require` to specify dependencies between services. The start order will be adjusted and any container that requires a port on a another container will wait for that port to become available before starting.

This example yaml file shows how some of the docker parameters look:

```
  templates:
    test_server_1:
      base_image: ubuntu
      config:
        ports: 
          - '8080' 
        command: '/bin/bash -c "apt-get install netcat ; nc -l 8080 -k"' 
        hostname: test_server_1 
        user: root
        detach: true
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        mem_limit: 2560000
        environment: 
          - ENV_VAR=testing
        dns: 
          - 8.8.8.8
          - 8.8.4.4
        volumes: 
          /var/testing: {}
```

**Note:** *Command is required by the Docker Python api and having to specify it here can cause problems with images that pre-define entrypoints and commands.*

**Note:** *the syntax for volumes is not fully specified and bind mounts are not currently supported.*

Command Line Tools
===

The command line tool is called `maestro` and initial enironments are defined in `maestro.yml`. If there is a `maestro.yml` in the current directory it will be automatically used otherwise the `-f` option can be used to specify the location of the file.

The environment state will be saved to a file named `environment.yml` and commands that manipulate existing environments will look for an `environment.yml` in the current directory or it can be specified by the `-e` option.

`maestro build`

Setup a new environment using a `maestro.yml` specification.

`maestro start [node_name]`

Start an existing environment that had been previously stopped and saved in `environment.yml`. If `node_name` is provided just that node will be stopped.

`maestro stop [node_name]`

Stop all containers in an environment and save the state to `environment.yml` If `node_name` is provided just that node will be stopped.

`maestro run template [commandline]`

Run a new instance of the template in the environment. *Limited functionality on this currently*

`maestro destroy`

Destroy all containers defined in an environment. Once destroyed the containers can not be recoved.

`maestro ps`

Show the status of the containers in an environment.

Roadmap
